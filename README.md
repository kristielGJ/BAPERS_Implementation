# BAPERS_Implementation
This project is programed in Java using Mysql
-------------------
This is a deliverable of the Group Project
-------------------
The purpose of the project is to improve the current system at BIPL which is completely manual. 
The current system has resulted in the company staff only being able to carry out 30 tasks at a time. 
The succession of the BAPERS project aims to allow Bloomsbury to increase the number of jobs and tasks staff are expected to complete for the companyâ€™s customers, allowing them to efficiently operate based on a high-turnover, low profit margin.
